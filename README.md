Full stack software engineer with a double major in Women's & Gender Studies and Spanish. I spent some time in the nonprofit world throughout and after undergrad before joining a coding bootcamp. I'm interested in the intersections of activism and tech.

Lately I've been working on Reticula, an interactive identities dictionary that encourages users to self-explore. Written in Typescript using React, Redux and Node.js.

Also in the works is my personal website - stay tuned!
