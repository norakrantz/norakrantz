Pronouns: she/her

Full stack software engineer with a double major in Women's & Gender Studies and Spanish. I spent some time in the nonprofit world throughout and after undergrad before joining a coding bootcamp. I'm interested in the intersections of activism and tech.

Lately I've been working on \[Code]opoly, an interview prep game built with Phaser, React, Redux, Firestore and Socket.io that lets players raise seed money and build up their tech stack in a race to be first to launch their startup.

Also in the works is my personal website (React) - stay tuned!
