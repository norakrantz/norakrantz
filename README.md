# Hello!

Pronouns: she/her

I'm currently working on my Grace Hopper (Fullstack Academy) Capstone project, \[Code]opoly, with my project mates. \[Code]opoly is an interview prep game built using Javascript, Phaser, React, Redux, Firestore and Socket.io that lets players raise seed money and build up their tech stack in a race to be first to launch their startup.

I'm also working on my Stackathon project, goodbuy, a Chrome Extension that suggests ethical shopping alternatives for users browsing Amazon.
