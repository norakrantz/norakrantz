# Hello!

Pronouns: she/her

Full stack software engineer with a double major in Women's & Gender Studies and Spanish. I spent some time in the nonprofit world throughout and after undergrad before joining a coding bootcamp. I'm interested in the intersections of activism and tech.

I'm currently working on my Capstone project, \[Code]opoly, with my project mates. \[Code]opoly is an interview prep game built using Javascript, Phaser, React, Redux, Firestore and Socket.io that lets players raise seed money and build up their tech stack in a race to be first to launch their startup.

Also in the works is my personal website (React) - stay tuned!


Proficient: JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js, Express, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, WordPress

Experience: Chrome Extensions, Material UI, TDD (Mocha, Chai, Jasmine), Firebase/Firestore, Phaser
